## Dataset
**Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/srcole/burritos-in-san-diego  

**Cleaned Data With:** Python

**What was Cleaned:**
A Python algorithm was used to search for blank cells and fills it 
with its respective column’s most recently identified value, as blank 
cells in this dataset are simply a result of being repeated from the 
same restaurant (but different burritos).  If a singular restaurant 
with no address or neighborhood was filled, it was removed.

**New JavaScript Library Used:** 
JQuery
