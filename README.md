Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/srcole/burritos-in-san-diego

Cleaned Data With: 
Python

What was Cleaned:
A Python algorithm was used to search for blank cells and fills it 
with its respective column’s most recently identified value, as blank 
cells in this dataset are simply a result of being repeated from the 
same restaurant (but different burritos).  If a singular restaurant 
with no address or neighborhood was filled, it was removed.
